Day 1 — EDA Observations

1.Dataset Overview
   - Total rows: <fill rows>
   - Total columns: <fill columns>
   - Numeric and categorical features identified

2.Missing Values
   - Some columns have missing values
   - Visualized using heatmap
   - Plan: handle missing values during preprocessing

3.Feature Distributions
   - Numeric features: distributions checked via histograms and boxplots
   - Outliers visible in some features
   - Skewed distributions noted

4.Target Variable
   - Target distribution visualized
   - Classes appear slightly imbalanced → can handle via weighting or SMOTE

5.Correlation Matrix
   - Only numeric columns considered
   - Strong correlation observed between <fill correlated features if any>
   - No perfect multicollinearity detected

6. **Next Steps**
   - Proceed with feature engineering & preprocessing pipeline
